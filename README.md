# Stardew-Valley-Animation-Canceling

This script allows you to animation cancel in Stardew Valley by pressing the mouse 5 button. Animation canceling in stardew valley cancels part of the animation for swinging a tool, allowing you to swing the tool again faster than you would be able to without animation canceling. By holding down the mouse 5 button, input is sent to repeatedly swing the selected tool, and cancel the animation, resulting in a much faster usage of the tool.

Since this script is only active when Stardew Valley is open, I recommend placing it in your startup folder so it works seamlessly every time you play the game without needing to run it beforehand and close it after.
